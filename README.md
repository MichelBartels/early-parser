Run using `ocaml early.ml`

I have removed `ppx_deriving` as a depedency so it can be run directly. However, now the output is really hard to read so if you prefer installing the library and having a nicer output, have a look at the [nicer-printing branch](https://github.com/MichelBartels/early-parser/tree/nicer-printing).
